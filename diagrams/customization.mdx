# Diagram Customization

Control how your auto-generated diagrams look and what they show.

## Controls
- **Layouts:** Toggle network-first vs service-first grouping.
- **Layers:** Show/hide networking (VPC/VNet, subnets), security (SGs/firewalls), data, compute.
- **Badges:** Toggle cost overlays, warnings (public buckets, wide-open SGs), health hints.
- **Labels:** Friendly names vs Terraform resource addresses.
- **Focus:** Filter by environment, tag, or module.

## How to Use
1. Open the diagram and click **Customize**.
2. Select layout (Network | Services) and layers to display.
3. Enable/disable cost and warning badges as needed.
4. Save as a **view preset** for your team (coming soon).

## Current Status
- Available for AWS and DigitalOcean diagrams.
- Exports honor your current view (PNG/SVG).
- Coming soon: saved presets, shareable links, and dark/light theme toggles.

## Tips
- Start with **network view** to validate routing and exposure.
- Turn on **warnings** when reviewing security posture.
- Use **labels → friendly names** for stakeholder reviews.
