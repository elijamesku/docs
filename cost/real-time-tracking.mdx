## How It Works

Kyrna tracks AWS costs in real-time while you write Terraform code.

**Status:** Working for AWS only

## What You See

## Example

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"          # 💰 $8.35/month
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  instance_class   = "db.t3.medium"   # 💰 $61.32/month
  engine          = "postgres"
  allocated_storage = 100              # 💰 $11.50/month
}

# Total: $81.17/month
```

## Current Limitations

<Warning>
  **AWS Only**

  Currently only supports AWS. GCP, Azure, and DigitalOcean support coming later.
</Warning>

**What's NOT included:**

- Data transfer costs (highly variable)
- API request costs
- Reserved Instance discounts
- Actual billing (estimates only)

## Budget Alerts

Set monthly budget and get alerts:

```
Budget: $500/month
Current: $425 (85%)
⚠️ Alert triggered
```

**Status:** Basic implementation

## Accuracy

- Uses official AWS pricing APIs
- Estimates only (not actual bills)
- Updated regularly
- Some specialized instances may show "Contact AWS"
