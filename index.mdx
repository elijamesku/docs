Welcome to Kyrna Docs. Kyrna is an AI-powered platform for infrastructure code generation with built-in cost tracking and security scanning.

## What is Kyrna?

Kyrna helps you write infrastructure code faster using AI. Type what you want in natural language, and Kyrna generates production-ready Terraform code.

## Current Features

What's actually implemented and working:

### AI Code Generation
- Natural language to Terraform conversion
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4 support
- Context-aware generation
- Multi-resource support (VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, etc.)

### Cost Intelligence
- Real-time AWS cost estimation
- 15+ AWS resource types supported
- Per-resource cost breakdown
- Budget alerts

### Security & Compliance
- Drift detection (code vs deployed)
- Basic security scanning
- Terraform validate/fmt integration
- Auto-heal for common issues

### Development Tools
- Diff approval workflow
- Git integration (commit, branch, PR)
- Architecture diagram generation
- Documentation generation

### Supported Platform
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (only)
- **IaC Language:** Terraform (only)
- **AI Models:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4

## What We're Building

This is an MVP. We're working toward a complete cloud operating system, but today you get:
- Working AI code generation
- Real-time cost tracking
- Basic security/drift features
- Git workflow tools
