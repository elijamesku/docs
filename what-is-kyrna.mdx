## Overview

Kyrna is an AI-powered platform for infrastructure code generation. We help you write Terraform faster than ever using natural language, with real-time cost tracking, security scanning, and **real-time team collaboration** built-in.

**Current Status:** MVP with working features, building toward a complete cloud operating system.

## What We've Actually Built

### 1. AI Code Generation

**What it does:**

- Type natural language \>\> Get Terraform code
- Uses Claude 4.5 Sonnet or GPT-5
- Generates EC2, RDS, S3, VPC, Lambda, etc.
- Context-aware (understands resource relationships)

**Example:**

```
You type: "Create a web server with PostgreSQL database"

Kyrna generates:
- aws_instance (EC2)
- aws_db_instance (RDS)
- aws_security_group
- aws_subnet
- all configurations
- docs explaining what was created and why
```

### 2. Real-Time Cost Tracking

**What it does:**

- Shows AWS costs while you code
- Covers 50+ AWS resource types
- Monthly and hourly breakdowns
- Budget alerts

**Supported AWS Resources:**

- EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda
- S3, EBS, CloudWatch
- VPC, Subnets, Security Groups
- ELB, ALB, Route53
- and more...

AWS only with GCP + Azure coming soon!

### 3. Security & Drift Detection

**What it does:**

- Detects drift (code vs deployed state)
- Basic security scanning
- Terraform validate/fmt
- Auto-heal for common Terraform errors

**Current Status:** Basic MVP, improving

### 4. Development Workflow

**What it does:**

- Diff approval (review before commit)
- Baked in Terraform fmt + validate with auto heal logic baked in
- Git integration (branch, commit, PR)
- Diagram generation (from Terraform)
- Documentation generation (from Terraform)

### 5. Real-Time Team Collaboration

**What it does:**

- Google Docs-style real-time collaboration for infrastructure
- See teammates' changes live
- Live presence indicators (who's editing what)
- Conflict prevention and warnings
- Team PR workflow (collaborative pull requests)

**Status:** MVP with presence tracking and file activity

### 6. Team Management

**What it does:**

- Create teams and invite members
- Role-based access control (Admin, Developer, Viewer)
- Shared repositories across teams
- Team billing and subscriptions
- Email invitations with secure tokens

**Status:** Working

### 7. Multi-Cloud Support

**What it does:**

- AWS infrastructure generation (30+ resource types)
- DigitalOcean infrastructure generation (18+ resource types)
- Cloud provider toggle in chat interface
- Cost estimation for both providers
- Security scanning for both providers

**Status:** AWS fully supported, DigitalOcean fully supported

### 8. AWS Infrastructure Import

**What it does:**

- Convert existing AWS infrastructure to Terraform
- Import from AWS CLI output, CloudFormation, AWS Config
- No AWS credentials required on our side
- Natural language descriptions supported
- Batch import capabilities

**Status:** Working

## Who Uses Kyrna

**Current users:**

- Individual developers using Terraform
- Small teams building + managing AWS/DigitalOcean infrastructure
- Teams collaborating on infrastructure in real-time
- Engineers that desire to deploy infra
- Teams migrating existing AWS infrastructure to Terraform

**Coming soon:**

- Large enterprises (SSO/RBAC)
- Additional cloud providers (GCP, Azure)

## Pricing

**Current:**

- Free during MVP phase
- Early access for testing
