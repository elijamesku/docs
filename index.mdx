Welcome to Kyrna Docs. Kyrna is an AI-powered platform for infrastructure code generation with built-in cost tracking and security scanning.

## What is Kyrna?

Kyrna helps you write infrastructure code faster using AI. Type what you want in natural language, and Kyrna generates production-ready Terraform code.
