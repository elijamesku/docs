## Overview

Kyrna is an AI-powered platform for infrastructure code generation. We help you write Terraform faster using natural language, with real-time cost tracking and security scanning built-in.

**Current Status:** MVP with working features, building toward a complete cloud operating system.

## What We've Actually Built

### 1. AI Code Generation

**What it does:**
- Type natural language → Get Terraform code
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4
- Generates EC2, RDS, S3, VPC, Lambda, etc.
- Context-aware (understands resource relationships)

**Example:**
```
You type: "Create a web server with PostgreSQL database"

Kyrna generates:
- aws_instance (EC2)
- aws_db_instance (RDS)
- aws_security_group
- aws_subnet
- All configurations
```

### 2. Real-Time Cost Tracking

**What it does:**
- Shows AWS costs while you code
- Covers 15+ AWS resource types
- Monthly and hourly breakdowns
- Budget alerts

**Supported AWS Resources:**
- EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda
- S3, EBS, CloudWatch
- VPC, Subnets, Security Groups
- ELB, ALB, Route53

**Current Limitation:** AWS only (no GCP/Azure yet)

### 3. Security & Drift Detection

**What it does:**
- Detects drift (code vs deployed state)
- Basic security scanning
- Terraform validate/fmt
- Auto-heal for common Terraform errors

**Current Status:** Basic MVP, improving

### 4. Development Workflow

**What it does:**
- Diff approval (review before commit)
- Git integration (branch, commit, PR)
- Diagram generation (from Terraform)
- Documentation generation

## Technical Stack

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python)
- PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet / GPT-4

**Frontend:**
- React + TypeScript
- Monaco Editor (VS Code engine)
- Electron (desktop app - in progress)

**Infrastructure:**
- Kubernetes deployment
- WebSocket for streaming
- JWT authentication

## What We DON'T Have (Yet)

Be honest about limitations:

❌ **Multi-cloud:** Only AWS (no GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean)  
❌ **Multi-IaC:** Only Terraform (no Pulumi, CDK, CloudFormation)  
❌ **Full IDE:** Monaco editor exists but desktop app in progress  
❌ **Team features:** No SSO, RBAC, or team workspaces  
❌ **Enterprise:** No on-premise, no SLA  

These are planned, just not built yet.

## Who Uses Kyrna

**Current users:**
- Individual developers learning Terraform
- Small teams building AWS infrastructure
- DevOps engineers prototyping
- Students/learners

**Not ready for:**
- Large enterprises (no SSO/RBAC)
- Multi-cloud teams (AWS only)
- Mission-critical production (MVP stage)

## Pricing

**Current:**
- Free during MVP phase
- Early access for testing

**Planned:**
- Individual: ~$15-25/month
- Team: ~$50/user/month
- Enterprise: Custom

## Roadmap

**Next 6 months:**
1. Complete desktop IDE
2. Improve security scanning
3. Add GCP support
4. Team collaboration features

**Next 12 months:**
5. Azure + DigitalOcean support
6. Pulumi code generation
7. Complete cloud OS vision
