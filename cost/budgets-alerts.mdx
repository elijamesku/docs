# Budgets & Alerts

Set monthly budgets, get alerts before overruns, and see which resources drive spend.

## How It Works
- Define **budget** per workspace, repo, or team (monthly cap).
- Kyrna sums projected monthly cost from your Terraform plan + existing resources.
- Alerts trigger at thresholds (default **70/85/100%**) via email/Slack/Discord.
- Shows top cost contributors so you know what to cut.

## Setup
1. Open **Cost → Budgets** in Kyrna.
2. Set scope: `workspace`, `team`, or `repo`.
3. Enter monthly limit (e.g., `$500`).
4. Choose channels: Email, Slack webhook, Discord webhook.
5. Pick thresholds (or keep defaults 70/85/100%).
6. Save — alerts start immediately.

## Example
```
Budget: $500/month
Current forecast: $425 (85%) → ⚠️ Alert
Top drivers:
- ALB (prod): $46
- NAT (prod): $36
- RDS db.r5.large (prod): $210
```

## Best Practices
- Separate budgets per **env** (dev/stage/prod) and **team**.
- Lower thresholds for dev (e.g., 50/70/90%) to catch waste early.
- Tag resources with `env`, `team`, `owner` for accurate grouping.
- Pair budgets with **lifecycle rules** (S3/Spaces) and **shutdown schedules** for dev.

## Current Status
- **Providers:** AWS, DigitalOcean
- **Notifications:** Email, Slack, Discord
- **Costs:** Estimates (pricing APIs), not actual cloud bills
- **Coming soon:** GCP/Azure, anomaly detection, daily spend burn alerts

## Troubleshooting
- If no alerts: check webhooks, thresholds, and that cost estimation is enabled.
- If numbers look off: refresh pricing; note that data transfer/API request costs are excluded.
