## Our Solution (Current State)

### What Works Now

**AI Code Generation:**

- Natural language \>\> Terraform
- AWS resources
- Diff editor
- Auto heal logic

**Cost Tracking:**

- Real-time AWS estimates
- 15+ resource types
- Budget alerts

**Security:**

- Basic drift detection
- Terraform validation
- Auto-heal for errors

**Status:** MVP, improving
