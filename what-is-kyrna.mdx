## Overview

Kyrna is the **complete AI-powered infrastructure development platform** that transforms how teams write, manage, and optimize cloud infrastructure. By combining a full-featured IDE, intelligent AI code generation, and comprehensive management tools, Kyrna makes infrastructure development faster, safer, and more cost-effective.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional infrastructure development is **slow, error-prone, and expensive**:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Steep Learning Curve" icon="chart-line">
    Terraform, CloudFormation, and cloud services require months to master
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hidden Costs" icon="dollar-sign">
    Teams discover costs after deployment, leading to budget overruns
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security Risks" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Misconfigurations go unnoticed until they're exploited
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fragmented Tools" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    Need 4-5 different tools: editor, cost calculator, security scanner, diagram tool
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Kyrna Solution

Kyrna brings everything into one **AI-powered platform**:

### 1. AI-Native Code Generation

Write infrastructure in **natural language**, not complex DSLs.

```text
Before (Traditional):
Hours of reading documentation
Trial and error with Terraform syntax
Copy-pasting from StackOverflow
Still unsure if it's correct

After (Kyrna):
Type: "Create a production web app with database"
Get: Production-ready Terraform in 30 seconds
With: Best practices, security, and cost optimization built-in
```

### 2. Real-Time Cost Intelligence

See costs **while coding**, not after deployment.

```
Traditional workflow:
Write code → Deploy → Check AWS bill → 😱 → Fix → Redeploy

Kyrna workflow:
Write code → See cost in real-time → Optimize before deploy → 😊
```

### 3. Built-In Security & Compliance

**Automatic scanning** catches issues before they reach production.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 4. Complete IDE Experience

Everything you need in **one place**.
