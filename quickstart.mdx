## Get Started

**Status:** MVP - some features still in development

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Visit [app.kyrna.com](https://app.kyrna.com) or join Discord at [kyrna.ai](https://kyrna.ai)
    
    **Note:** MVP stage, free during testing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try AI Generation">
    Generate Terraform from natural language.
    
    Example prompts:
    ```
    Create a web server on AWS
    
    Create a PostgreSQL database
    
    Create a VPC with public and private subnets
    ```
    
    **Current:** AWS + Terraform only
  </Step>

  <Step title="See Costs">
    Real-time AWS cost estimates appear automatically.
    
    Example:
    - t3.micro instance: $8.35/month
    - db.t3.medium RDS: $61.32/month
    
    **Current:** 15+ AWS resource types
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Security">
    Basic security scanning and drift detection.
    
    **Current:** MVP features, improving
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Works Now

✅ AI code generation (Claude/GPT-4)  
✅ Real-time AWS cost tracking  
✅ Basic security scanning  
✅ Drift detection  
✅ Git integration  
✅ Diagram generation  

## What's Not Ready

❌ Full desktop IDE (in progress)  
❌ Multi-cloud (AWS only)  
❌ Team features  
❌ Enterprise features  

## Example Usage

**Generate a web server:**
```
1. Type: "Create a web server with public IP"
2. Kyrna generates Terraform
3. See cost estimate
4. Review code
5. Deploy
```

**Cost:** ~$8-15/month for basic setup
