# Cost Optimization

Actionable steps to lower your cloud bill while using Kyrna.

## Quick Wins (Do These First)
- **Right-size instances:** Start with smaller EC2/Droplet sizes; scale up only if needed.
- **Turn off idle:** Auto-stop non-prod at night/weekends; tag with `env=dev` to target schedules.
- **Use managed services wisely:** Prefer RDS/Aurora/DO Databases over self-managed VMs when ops cost dominates.
- **Lifecycle policies:** Move S3/Spaces objects to cheaper storage after 30 days; delete unused snapshots.
- **Consolidate NAT/LB:** Share NAT gateways and load balancers across services where possible.

## Kyrna Features That Help
- **Real-time estimates:** See per-resource and total cost before committing.
- **Cost diffing:** Review cost deltas in PRs alongside Terraform changes.
- **Optimization prompts:** Ask the agent: "Optimize this VPC stack for cost" to resize, compress storage, and reduce NAT/LB count.
- **Policy checks:** Warnings for costly patterns (public buckets, wide-open SGs, unencrypted disks, idle ALBs/NATs).

## AWS-Specific Tips
- Prefer **gp3** over gp2; set provisioned IOPS only when required.
- Use **t3/t4g** for dev/test; switch to **spot** for stateless/CI.
- Combine services behind a single **ALB**; avoid orphaned LBs and target groups.
- **NAT gateways:** one per AZ in prod; in dev, use a single NAT where acceptable.
- **S3:** enable lifecycle to Glacier/IA; block public access by default.
- **RDS:** enable storage autoscaling; choose Graviton where supported; use shorter backup retention in dev.

## DigitalOcean-Specific Tips
- Start with smaller **droplets**; add CPU-optimized only when needed.
- Use **DOKS** node pools with autoscaling; right-size defaults.
- **Spaces:** enable CDN; lifecycle to transition old objects; avoid unnecessary replicas.
- **Databases:** choose starter tiers; enable auto-upgrade windows; restrict public access.
- **Load balancers:** prefer one per environment; clean unused forwarding rules.

## Storage & Data
- Set **retention** on logs/metrics; route to cheaper tiers after 30–90 days.
- Compress text assets; avoid duplicating large binaries in multiple buckets.
- Snapshot policies with expiration; delete unused AMIs/snapshots.

## Networking
- Limit **egress** by co-locating services; consider private links/peering.
- Remove unused **elastic/floating IPs**; clean stale DNS records.

## Governance
- Tag everything: `env`, `team`, `owner`, `cost-center` for attribution.
- Budgets & alerts per env/team; break-glass escalation when >80/90% of budget.
- Review monthly: biggest deltas, idle resources, zombie LBs/NATs/volumes.

## How to Use Kyrna to Optimize
1. **Generate with cost in mind:** Ask the agent to propose a low-cost version.
2. **Review diffs:** Check cost annotations and warnings before merging.
3. **Add lifecycle:** Ask Kyrna to add lifecycle rules to S3/Spaces and backups.
4. **Scan regularly:** Run security/cost scan on repos weekly; fix flagged items.
