# 🚀 Team PR Workflow - The $100M Feature

## Overview

**Kyrna's Team PR Workflow** is a game-changing feature that transforms how infrastructure teams collaborate on pull requests. Instead of the traditional Git workflow (clone → branch → commit → push → PR), teams work together in **real-time shared workspaces**, building PRs collaboratively like Figma designs.

**No competitor has this.**

---

## 🎯 Why This Is Valuable

### Traditional Workflow (Every Competitor)

```
❌ Clone repo locally
❌ Create branch
❌ Make changes alone
❌ Commit & push
❌ Create PR
❌ Wait for reviews
❌ Context switching
❌ Merge conflicts
❌ No visibility of teammates' work
```

### Kyrna's Team PR Workflow

```
✅ Work together in real-time
✅ See who's editing what
✅ Mark work as "Ready for PR"
✅ Create team PR with all contributions
✅ Everyone gets credit
✅ No merge conflicts (caught early)
✅ Fast iteration
✅ Team coordination built-in
```

## 🔥 Key Features

### 1. **PR Intent System**

Team members can set their work status:

- **⏸️ Work in Progress** - Still making changes, not ready yet
- **🚀 Ready for PR** - Changes complete, ready to submit

### 2. **Smart Team PR Builder**

When creating a PR, see exactly what everyone contributed:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Create Team Pull Request           │
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Contributors:                      │
│                                    │
│ ✅ 🟣 Sarah Chen         🚀 Ready  │
│    ✏️ networking.tf (3 files)     │
│    +127 -45                        │
│                                    │
│ ✅ 🟢 Mike Rodriguez    🚀 Ready   │
│    ✏️ security.tf (2 files)       │
│    +89 -23                         │
│                                    │
│ ⚠️ 🔵 You                ⏸️ Draft  │
│    ✏️ main.tf (1 file)            │
│    +54 -12                         │
│                                    │
│ [Include draft work?]              │
│ [Create Team PR]                   │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Smart features:**
- ✅ Auto-selects contributors marked "Ready"
- ⚠️ Warns about including work-in-progress
- 📊 Shows stats (files, lines added/removed)
- 👥 Everyone gets PR credit as co-author

### 3. **Real-Time Coordination**

Team sees everything as it happens:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 👥 3 online                        │
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🟣 Sarah Chen          🚀 Ready    │
│    ✏️ editing networking.tf        │
│                                    │
│ 🟢 Mike Rodriguez     🚀 Ready     │
│    ✏️ editing security.tf          │
│                                    │
│ 🔵 You                 ⏸️ Draft    │
│    ✏️ editing main.tf              │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

// Create a draft PR that team builds together
<button onClick={() => createDraftPR('Add monitoring')}>
  📝 Start Team PR Draft
</button>

// Everyone's changes auto-add to the draft
// When ready, anyone submits it
```

### Phase 3: File Locking

```typescript
// Hard lock option for sensitive files
<FileLock 
  file="production.tf"
