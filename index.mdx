## Quick Start Example

New to Kyrna? Here's what it looks like in action:

```
You type: "Create a production web application with a load balancer, 
          auto-scaling web servers, and a managed PostgreSQL database"

Kyrna AI generates:
✓ Application Load Balancer (ALB)
✓ Auto Scaling Group with launch template
✓ EC2 instances with security groups
✓ RDS PostgreSQL database
✓ VPC networking and subnets
✓ All necessary IAM roles

Real-time cost: $247/month

You review, approve, and deploy.
```

**That's Kyrna. Infrastructure at the speed of thought.**
