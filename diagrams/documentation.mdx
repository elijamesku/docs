# Auto-Generated Documentation

Create readable docs from your Terraform automatically, including diagrams and cost/security context.

## What It Produces
- **Resource summaries:** Purpose, key attributes, dependencies.
- **Architecture diagrams:** Linked views for network and services.
- **Cost snapshot:** Estimated monthly totals and top contributors.
- **Security notes:** Public endpoints, open security groups, missing encryption/backups.
- **Change log:** What changed in this PR compared to main.

## How to Use
1. Generate or import Terraform in Kyrna.
2. Open **Docs** for the workspace or PR.
3. Export as Markdown or share via link.

## Current Status
- Providers: AWS, DigitalOcean
- Formats: In-app viewer, Markdown export
- Includes: Diagrams, cost estimates, security notes, change summary
- Coming soon: PDF export and custom sections/templates

## Best Practices
- Attach exported docs to PRs for reviewers.
- Use as onboarding material for new team members.
- Pair with budgets/alerts to keep costs visible.
