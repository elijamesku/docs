Welcome to Kyrna Docs. Kyrna is an AI-powered platform for infrastructure code generation with built-in cost tracking, security scanning, and **real-time team collaboration**.

## What is Kyrna?

Kyrna helps you write infrastructure code faster using AI. Type what you want in natural language, and Kyrna generates production-ready Terraform code. Collaborate with your team in real-time, manage infrastructure across AWS and DigitalOcean, and import existing infrastructure.

## What We're Building

This is an MVP. We're working toward a complete cloud operating system, but today you get:

- Working AI code generation (AWS & DigitalOcean)
- Real-time cost tracking (both providers)
- Basic security/drift features
- Git workflow tools
- Real-time team collaboration
- Team management with RBAC
- AWS infrastructure import
- Automated diagrams + documentation
- \+ more
