## Overview

Kyrna is an AI-powered platform for infrastructure code generation. We help you write Terraform faster than ever using natural language, with real-time cost tracking and security scanning built-in.

**Current Status:** MVP with working features, building toward a complete cloud operating system.

## What We've Actually Built

### 1. AI Code Generation

**What it does:**

- Type natural language \>\> Get Terraform code
- Uses Claude 4.5 Sonnet or GPT-5
- Generates EC2, RDS, S3, VPC, Lambda, etc.
- Context-aware (understands resource relationships)

**Example:**

```
You type: "Create a web server with PostgreSQL database"

Kyrna generates:
- aws_instance (EC2)
- aws_db_instance (RDS)
- aws_security_group
- aws_subnet
- all configurations
- docs explaining what was created and why
```

### 2. Real-Time Cost Tracking

**What it does:**

- Shows AWS costs while you code
- Covers 50+ AWS resource types
- Monthly and hourly breakdowns
- Budget alerts

**Supported AWS Resources:**

- EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda
- S3, EBS, CloudWatch
- VPC, Subnets, Security Groups
- ELB, ALB, Route53
- and more...

AWS only with GCP + Azure coming soon!

### 3. Security & Drift Detection

**What it does:**

- Detects drift (code vs deployed state)
- Basic security scanning
- Terraform validate/fmt
- Auto-heal for common Terraform errors

**Current Status:** Basic MVP, improving

### 4. Development Workflow

**What it does:**

- Diff approval (review before commit)
- Baked in Terraform fmt + validate with auto heal logic baked in
- Git integration (branch, commit, PR)
- Diagram generation (from Terraform)
- Documentation generation (from Terraform)

## Who Uses Kyrna

**Current users:**

- Individual developers usingTerraform
- Small teams building + managing AWS infrastructure
- Engineers that desire to deploy infra

**Coming soon:**

- Large enterprises (SSO/RBAC)
- Multi-cloud teams

## Pricing

**Current:**

- Free during MVP phase
- Early access for testing

**Planned:**

- Individual: ~\$15-25/month
- Team: ~\$200/user/month
- Enterprise: Custom
