# Cost Comparison

Compare multiple designs or instance sizes before committing them to code.

## What You Can Compare
- Instance sizes (t3.micro vs t3.small vs m5.large)
- Storage classes (S3 Standard vs Glacier, Spaces tiers)
- Databases (RDS vs Aurora vs DO Managed DBs)
- Load balancers (ALB vs NLB; DO LB sizing)
- Compute models (EC2 On-Demand vs Spot; ECS Fargate vs EC2)
- Region differences (us-east-1 vs eu-west-1 vs ap-southeast-1)

## How to Use
1. In chat, ask: **"Compare cost of a t3.micro vs t3.small web tier in us-east-1"**
2. Kyrna returns a table with monthly/hourly estimates and key notes (performance, limits).
3. Pick an option, then ask Kyrna to generate Terraform for that choice.

## Example Output
```
Option              Hourly    Monthly   Notes
---------------------------------------------------------
t3.micro ALB stack  $0.03     ~$21     Good for low traffic; 1 vCPU / 1GB
m5.large ALB stack  $0.21     ~$150    Higher throughput; 2 vCPU / 8GB
Spot m5.large       ~$0.06    ~$43     70%+ cheaper; interruptions possible
```

## Tips
- Always factor **egress** if cross-region or internet-heavy.
- Use **spot** for stateless/CI; avoid for stateful DBs.
- For DO, start with smaller droplets and scale node pools.
- Check **storage + backup + data transfer** together; they often exceed compute.

## Current Status
- Supports AWS and DigitalOcean comparisons.
- Estimates from pricing APIs; excludes unpredictable egress/API request costs.
- Coming soon: saved comparison presets and team-shared templates.
